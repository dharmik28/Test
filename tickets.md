# GitHub support tenets: a tl;dr

### Logic + empathy

It's a satisfying balance to bring both analytical skills to a problem, but also remember to respond to a user with care.

### Transparency + honesty

We put effort into writing up [post-mortem blog posts about What Went Wrong](https://github.blog/2022-03-23-an-update-on-recent-service-disruptions/). The balance here is to show enough transparency so users feel respected, but in the case where things are horribly wrong, not share so much that we overwhelm them.

[Here's an example of a support request](https://gist.github.com/3e89df1f7c0e7d6d5737). It may be easier to say something vague and not-technically-untrue like "there was a small problem and we fixed it". It means we don't have to cop to a mistake on our end. Our users are in the tech world, and are used to figuring out problems. We have found we're much better off telling them what's up, and why.

### Surprise + delight

We have an awesome user base, who generally think we're pretty great. We've put a lot of social effort into meetups, conference talks and blog posts that wow people and create fans of our company and the products we [ship](http://shipitsquirrel.github.io/images/ship%20it%20squirrel.png).

We follow the [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service), and go above and beyond when it's appropriate. We have the ability to refund as much as we want, and to offer coupons as often as we want. We use this judiciously, as you can turn a surprise into disappointment if wielded badly. You can go back to logic+empathy to consider if what you'd like to do will actually delight the user.

Often, our users may just need information quickly and clearly, without being goofy. We have to know how to respond in the way that best matches how the user is feeling.

## GitHub voice

To explain it casually, we try to exude something that sounds like the person:

* is a real human
* is invested in things going well for you (we care)
* is really smart, but kind (not egotistical)
* and maybe kind of funny (good robot test)
* or at least interesting (and also not actually a robot)
* is not businessy
* could be found in a hoodie, blaring music, slouching in a bean bag chair

## Humble brag

Here's what someone wrote about us, in a longer piece about moving their company to GitHub:

> This leads me to the Customer Service itself. The GitHub staff I’ve been in contact with is extremely helpful, efficient, and comprehensive of our specific requirements. Most important: you deal with real people with real names, not with an anonymous service. When a member of the support staff takes your case (which happens in minutes, even for us Europeans), you get in touch with this person each time you interact on the case. And their CRM tools seem good enough so that your customer history is quickly available to all the support staff. I must say that I didn’t expect such a good customer service from a company with a reputation of automating everything they can, but they really take customer relationship seriously.

## An FYI on how we work

Most of the support team is remote, so we use a group chat room and a support app to work together. We also use GitHub -- it's where the code is stored, where we log bugs, and where we collaborate on new ideas. We don't tend to email or call each other, though we'll videochat every once in a while to catch up. Mostly we hang out in the support chat room to communicate.

## Ticket #1: Rejected pull request from fork

> To start, I have to say I LOVE GITHUB. You guys rock. I was at your 4th birthday party, thanks for the cupcake and booze!
>
> Anyway, here's my problem. I sent a pull request to technoweenie, and he rejected it because my master branch is out of sync with his master. What can I do to fix this?
>
> Help me supportocat, you're my only hope!
>
> /.Steve

Hint: You'll want to address their question, and you could add an explanation of topic branches as a better workflow.


### Ticket #1 response:

Hi Steve, 

Hope you are doing well & thanks for your wishes



## Ticket #2: Syncing internal server and GitHub?

> Hi GitHub! My company has an internal Git server used for deployments, we use GitHub, and I work on a local copy of the repository. For workflow purposes, how do I sync my repository to GitHub and the internal Git server?
>
> Thanks,  
> vmg

Hint: One common option is Git remotes. There are others!


### Ticket #2 response:

_replace this with your response_



## Ticket #3: Unhappy about forking

> JamesTK here, I have another question.
>
> One of my dev collaborator forked my private repo without explicit permission to do so... is that typical? I am surprised that the system did not notify me if it was okay to grant the fork permission. Is there a way to setup permissions of this sort? Also, other than asking the collaborator to delete the forked repo, can I actually delete it?
>
> Thanks, jamestk

Notes:

You've checked the account in our admin view, he only has one personal repository (jamestk/tribbles), which has one collaborator. Any documentation you may need is available on [help.github.com](https://help.github.com).


### Ticket #3 response:
